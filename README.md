README: FIFA 22 Players Analysis

This project focuses on exploring various attributes, strategies, and values of players in the FIFA 22 game. Using R for data analysis and visualization, the project aims to provide insights into player ratings, club strategies, player wages, and attributes that lead to higher market value, particularly for forward players. Below is the summary of the methodology and findings:

1. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
The dataset was transformed to address missing values and convert currency-related strings in ‘Value’ and ‘Wage’ to numerical values. The 'Overall' ratings of the players were analyzed, focusing on players in outfield positions.

2. High-rated Players Analysis:
Players with an 'Overall' rating above 80 were isolated to study club strategies concerning high-rated players. Atlético de Madrid was identified to have the highest number of players (19) with ratings over 80, surpassing clubs like Manchester City, Real Madrid CF, and FC Barcelona, which one might expect to lead in this regard. However, in terms of player wages, Real Madrid CF was found to have the highest expenditure.

 3. Market Value Analysis:
The analysis was narrowed down to forward players (ST, RW, LW, CF) to understand the attributes that contribute to higher market value. The Random Forest model was employed to capture relationships between variables. It was found that 'Reactions' was the most influential attribute affecting a player’s market value, followed by 'BallControl', 'Finishing', 'Dribbling', 'Positioning', 'ShortPassing', and 'Age'. 

4. Findings:
- Atlético de Madrid has a surprising number of high-rated players.
- Real Madrid CF has the highest wage expenditure among top clubs.
- For forward players, 'Reactions' is crucial in determining market value, hinting that responsiveness is highly valued along with ‘Finishing’ and ‘Dribbling’.
- Defensive attributes like ‘Interceptions’, ‘Defensive Awareness’, ‘Sliding Tackle’, ‘Jumping’, and ‘Aggression’ are at the bottom in terms of affecting market value for forwards, indicating a potential undervaluation of these attributes.

 5. Implications and Reflection:
These insights could help in forming game strategies and could reflect potential real-world football scenarios and player management strategies. The attributes that are valued in the game might offer a perspective on what is valued in the actual football market and player acquisition strategies. The seeming undervaluation of defensive attributes may provide opportunities for acquiring quality players with these attributes at lower costs, both in-game and potentially, in real-world scenarios.
